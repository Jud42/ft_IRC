# ft_IRC

A chat server implementing the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol, developed in C++98. The server allows users to connect, create and join chat channels, send messages, and interact with other users using IRC commands. This project was carried out in collaboration with two other talented members of my team. I had the opportunity to actively contribute to the implementation of essential features such as connection management, mode handling, and the implementation of specific commands. I enjoyed working on these aspects and contributing to the overall project.

> We did not need to develop the client or handle server-to-server communication.
